# Health check demo     
Adding health checks in a .NET Core application for .NET Conf 2020.    
* We’ll look at setting up basic health checks for our ASP.NET Core application using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks` package.   
* Next, we’ll update our health check to include a database resource that this application depends on.     
* After that, we’ll look at filtering health checks on resources using `MapWhen` and `Predicate` and when you might require to use them.
